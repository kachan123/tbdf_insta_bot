# tbdf_insta_bot
Objective: To search given tags for a list of users, then auto follow them and unfollow them. 

Order of priorities: 
1. Getting auto follow to work 
2. Getting the hashtag scraping to generate a list of users to auto follow 
3. Getting the bot to do other engagements (liking, commenting)
